# Exercise:  

Given a .txt file that has a list of a bunch of names, count how many of each name there are in the file, and print out the results to the screen. Here is a [.txt file](https://www.practicepython.org/assets/nameslist.txt) for you, if you want to use it.

# Extras:  

* Instead of using the .txt file from above, take this [.txt file](https://www.practicepython.org/assets/Training_01.txt), and count how many of each “category” of each image there are. This text file is actually a list of files corresponding to the [SUN database](http://sundatabase.mit.edu/) scene recognition database, and lists the file directory hierarchy for the images. Once you take a look at the first line or two of the file, it will be clear which part represents the scene category.
